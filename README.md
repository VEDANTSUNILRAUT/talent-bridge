🤖 AI Mock Interview Integration
Our AI Mock Interview feature uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to generate real-time questions based on job roles.

How it Works:
1️⃣ User selects a job role (e.g., Software Engineer)
2️⃣ AI generates role-specific interview questions
3️⃣ Users respond via text or voice
4️⃣ AI provides feedback & improvement suggestions
